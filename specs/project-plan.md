## Project overview

### Purpose and scope of the project

The aim of the project is to create a system supporting the work of canteens. The system's task is to inform customers about cafeteria state to saves their time and helps them decide whether to go for lunch at given time. They should know how many people are currently having lunch and what the menu is beforehands. With rating options, users can guide each other in search for the best dishes. Foreign visitors and disabled users can easily access all data on their devices.
Owners will benefit from analytics. Historical data and occupancy predictions help to prepare for lunch in advance, while updating customers mitigates traffic spikes. Publishing menus is a new marketing channel promoting cafe directly to interested users. Administration panel can automate posting to social media channels. Collected feedback will contribute to service improvements.

### Assumptions and dependencies

* Project is implemented as part of the subject "Software Engineering" during classes and the team's additional meetings.
* System is expected to be delivered by mid-June 2020.

on a voluntary basis.
