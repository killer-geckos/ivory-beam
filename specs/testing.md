# Testing specification

Version number: 1.0

Authors: Krzysztof Antoniak, Robert Michna, Maciej Procyk

### Changelog

* v1.0: Initial revision

### Overview

This document provides testing strategy for all system components. Functional and non-functional 
tests are broken down by type in separate sections. Each component checks can be performed separately, 
except for integration testing.

## Functional tests

### Unit testing

#### Django server

Django [unit tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/testing/overview/) allow us to test many aspects of the server:
* Database tests, assuring that the database follows the designed model, works well under load and is 
properly configured. Also some rollback emulation testing
* Normal unit tests for testing the server app against code bugs.

#### Android application

Android application can be tested using local tests running on developer computer as well as the 
instrumented tests which run on Android device (or its emulator in automated environment).

* **Local tests** are compiled to bytecode and run on JVM. They should test the logic of every 
individual part of Android app in order to easily catch software regressions introduced by new 
changes to code.
 The [Roboelectric](http://robolectric.org/) library is designed to emulate Android framework 
 part in such tests and should be used in tests writing process.
*  **Instrumented tests** are to be run on Android emulator  because they need access to real 
device resources. They are useful in testing functionalities which cannot be easily mocked by 
frameworks. Good example is a test that validates a good implementation of *Parcelable* interface.

These types of tests are to be defined as a part of Android project in separate directories and 
can be run on single developer workstation. There should be also definitions of testing parts in 
github workflows that makes the releases of debug and offical versions of application.
They would run as the Gradle tasks as a pre-build process that give an access to release part 
(when successfully completed).

#### Camera devices

Camera device code is covered by `pytest` unit tests. These tests can be run twofold:

* **Local environment**: Call `pytest /camera/rpi-files/` or `./camera/rpi-files/format-lint-test.sh` 
for all checks.

* **Automated GitHub workflow**: All tests are run automatically when you try to merge code into 
`master` branch. If any test fails, GitHub prevents PR merging. For implementation details, see 
`camera_cq` workflow [here](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/blob/master/.github/workflows/camera_cq.yaml).

### Integration testing
The  integration tests should allow to check the work of the groups of units. They should test 
the interactions between integrated components or even parts of system.
 
#### Android application

In android projects integration tests shoukd validate the app's behaviour from the module level. 
They  can test:
* the cached repository layer that interacts with external sources of data as well as caches some
 data internally
* interactions between Views and ViewModels can be tested by validating the layout XML

To carry out these type of tests the Espresso Intents library can be used. It allows to validate 
intents sent by the application under tests. It's like the standard Mockito library but created 
specially for Android Intents.


These tests are also to be run as the repository workflow that validates as the second step of 
Android build process the ability of the parts to be released.

### Smoke testing

#### Django server

The standard framework [django-smoke-tests](https://pypi.org/project/django-smoke-tests/) can be
 used in this part of tests to easily integrate them with Django system.

Smoke tests can be run by the developers or testers to check against any possible unwanted outcomes 
from http requests. 
This app identifies all possible endpoints by looking into django url files, runs the http requests 
and reports any unexpected responses. These tests enhance security of our server app.

#### Camera devices

Device smoke testing is a half manual process. Device must be configured before the test.

1. Tester turns on the device.
2. After defined time (e.g. 60 seconds) tester checks admin panel to confirm that device status in
 the panel is `on`.

Please note these steps are also part of the installability test.

### Acceptance/Beta testing

#### Android application

Android application should be tested manually done before releasing. All the business requirements 
are checked during this testing phrase. 

These tests should check if none of the unknown errors are thrown to user interface with the exception. 
The should also check the aesthetic and minimalist design of the application which makes it easy to 
use the base app features with a few taps on screen.

After the app crashes the standard logcat is available in Android devices with the url of the 
exception stacktrace. Thanks to this part Android environment the app doesn't have to be run plugged 
to cmoputer with Debugging enabled because all the needed data of exception reason can be obtained 
with described system of crash reports.

These tests can give the feedback to UI designers of the application about some unserviceable parts
 of the app that in most of the cases can be easily fixed but the feedback from users is needed.

#### Django server

Django provides a set of tools that come in candy when writing tests. usign the evry specified part of the model 
on the server is checked by writing standard requests to server run cocally as well as on the development environment.

These test would check if the API definitions are available on server and if requests to some basic 
API objects are done correctly. Special set of data is prepared to be loaded on such testing enviroment
using the JSON file which contains some human readable data for the database. Thanks to this mechanism the
received data from the API endpoint can be compared with the specified in this JSON file.

##### Automated Selenium use-case testing

Selenium allows for recording website-user interactions for later use in form of testing.
Selenium offers a quick way to check against any problems related to user interaction with the 
server, giving us the perfect way to test the admin part of the django app.

### Usability testing

#### Android application

Usability tests should be done by external testers who are not familiar with the technologies used 
in project to get the feedback on the app usability in basic use-cases. They should check if every part 
of the defined use-cases is usable for standard users and if there are no strange parts in user navigation
through the app interface which could cause the user getting lost.

## Non-functional tests

### Performance testing

#### Django server

In addition to manual testing, running unit tests for both server and camera devices gives enough 
insight into performance of the server app.

### Stress testing

#### Django server

Stress tests can be simulated by running multiple request to the server at the same time via 
camera devices. As for now, no further testing is required.

In the future the tests done by automated environments can be done. In order to do so the mocked 
clients of app can be written to simulate the usage of the system by many clients.
In this way most of the bottlenecks at the server side can by found by checking the server 
performance manually when mocked tests are evaluated.

### Maintainability testing

#### Camera devices

**Code quality checks**

Python code can be checked to `master` branch only if it adheres to Wemake Python Styleguide. 
Wemake is an overset of [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding standard. For 
implementation details, see `camera_cq` workflow definition [here](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/blob/master/.github/workflows/camera_cq.yaml).

### Installability testing

#### Django server

![Webserver deploy dev](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/workflows/Webserver%20deploy%20dev/badge.svg)
![Webserver deploy for production](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/workflows/Webserver%20deploy%20for%20production/badge.svg)

Django server app is deployed to production as well as the development environment which are located 
at the external servers. There are workflows which firstly deploy the application merged to production
 server and any other branch commits are deployed to development environment.

The workflow is realized using single API key from server which allows to deploy the whole application
 using standard bash commands. After deploying phase servers are pinged by the workflow if they are 
 set up correctly.  

#### Android application

![Build Android APK debug file](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/workflows/Build%20Android%20APK%20debug%20file/badge.svg)
![Build Android APK release unsigned file](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/workflows/Build%20Android%20APK%20release%20unsigned%20file/badge.svg)

Android application is build as the repository workflow which builds the release and debug versions 
of application using Gradle *assemble* and *assembleDebug* tasks in special docker image which allows
 to build the application

At the end of the process app is send to the production (after release) and development (after any 
successful build) server and are tested on different devices of project members by just downloading 
the standard APK files from server.
The app is tested on different size devices with different specs to gain certainty that it will run 
on most of the clients devices.

#### Camera devices

Camera installability test is a half-manual process. For the test to pass, all steps below must 
execute on any device matching specifications described in architecture specification.

1. Installation script reads user input:
    * device name,
    * device key,
    * Wifi network name,
    * Wifi network password,
    * API endpoint address.
2. Installation script generated card image file (`.img`).
3. Tester writes image file to an SD card.
4. Tester turns the device on.
5. After defined time (e.g. 60 seconds) tester checks admin panel to confirm that device status 
in the panel is `on`.

Installation script is a planned feature, see [#91](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/issues/91) 
for progress.

### Compliance testing

**OpenAPI 2.0 schema checker**: 

![API checks](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/workflows/API%20checks/badge.svg)

API definition file, `/specs/api.yaml`, must conform to OpenAPI 2.0 schema. 
Workflow [`api_checks`](https://github.com/pooh-labs/eaterslab/blob/master/.github/workflows/api_checks.yaml) enforces this requirement for each PR to branch `master`.
